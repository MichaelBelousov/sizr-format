# Stupid name, TreeStitcher

Scheme bindings for tree-sitter with an extension that enables transforming the AST of files in 
a "workspace" using embedded tree-sitter queries and real scheme code.

## Building

Hopefully just

```sh
zig build
```

## Potential Names

- TreeStitcher
- Trisp (tree-lisp)
- Tisp
- Sizr
- Sizr-lisp (so that sizr isn't taken when introduce a non-lisp tool)
- LSP

## TODO:

- add filtering to transformation API
- better define workspaces for a sample language (e.g. TypeScript package.json + tsconfig.json)
- better decouple logic in zig from ffi bindings to allow porting to other lisps
- generate AST builder scheme functions from `src/node_types.json`
- create a playground webpage so people don't need to download it to run it (would be great to use
  Monaco editor with LSP)
- create an interpreter and a REPL for interactively performing transformations across a "workspace",
  viewing transform patches, and confirming them, `git checkout --patch` style.
- prototype reference detection and renaming for a sample language
- see if it's possible to create an ABI-compatible tree-sitter fork that when loading a C++ language
  uses a clang based parser with the same ABI
- VSCode extension

## How to make an ABI and LISPs portable interface

- simple C interface taking a string representation of the lisp objected generated by the lisp layer
  returns a parseable AST string for each capture, lisp layer parses needed captures into an environment
  and evals the transform on them?

## Examples

See [the current in-development tests](./tests/cpp/simple.test.scm).
